My wife completely supports my LCHF way of eating, even if she’s not doing it herself. She loves to cook. It’s her passion and the kitchen is her artist’s studio. With her guidance, and in my attempt to free her from additional work for my WoE, I’ve started to cook much more frequently then I have in the past. What nice about LCHF is you begin to actually cook again, like we did decades ago, before pre-fabricated food became so common, cheap and easy to buy. You know, and care about, the ingredients you use. You check the labels. See how eight-syllable chemical compounds that frighten you.
