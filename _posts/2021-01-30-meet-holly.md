*This was my post the day after we adopted Holly from the <a href="https://spcawake.org">Wake County SPCA</a>. It is essentially copied from the SPCA pet catalog.*

### Original catalog text

My name is Holly, and I am a spayed female, white and brown brindle Pointer and American Staffordshire Terrier. I am 10 months old.

Hi there! My name’s Holly. One, two, three, go! Come on, let’s race! No, really! Come on! Just so you know, I’m a go-go-go kind of girl! I’m a little shy when we first meet but give me a couple of treats and a few minutes, and you’ll find me by your side in no time. I am also sweet, not to mention a cute little girl who’s looking for a family to keep up with me. Of course, I know whoever I end up with will love me and take care of me for the rest of my life. I occasionally indulge in coprophagia, but I’m sure a steady discipline will help me break this disgusting habit. I like finding new things to chew on, and my new parents will need to make sure I don’t get into anything I’m not supposed to. I will reward your patience with lots of kisses. Are you the perfect person for me? I currently weigh ~40 lbs. and should reach ~45-50lbs.
